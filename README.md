# simple stock price and volume app 

This is a simple app created with Streamlit and the yfinance library that displays the historical stock prices and trading volumes of selected stocks. Users can select a stock from a drop-down menu and choose a start and end date for the data, as well as the data interval.

The app displays two line charts for the selected stock: one for the close price and the other for the trading volume. The charts are interactive and users can zoom in and out to get a better view of the data.

To run the app, users must have Streamlit and yfinance **installed** on their local machines. The app can be run by executing the python script and opening the Streamlit URL in a web browser.
