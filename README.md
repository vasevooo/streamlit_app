# streamlit apps

There are two simple apps created with Streamlit: 
1. The Stock Price app displays two line charts for the selected stock: the close price and the trading volume. The charts are interactive, and users can zoom in and out to view the data better.
2. The tips app shows examples of visualization with Streamlit

**How to run the code:** 

1. Fork the repo to your GitHub, clone it to your local computer
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where the Python file is saved.
3. Run the following command to start the app:`streamlit run stock_price.py` or `streamlit run tips.py`
4. Streamlit should automatically open the app in a new tab in your default web browser. You can copy the URL in the terminal and paste it into your web browser if it doesn't.

Both apps are deployed and can be accessed here:
